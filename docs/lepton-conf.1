.SH NAME
lepton-conf \- Lepton EDA configuration utility

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lepton-conf
.RI [ OPTIONS ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B lepton-conf
is a graphical user interface configuration utility
for the Lepton Electronic Design Automation suite.
It allows one to explore and modify the new-style
settings stored in \fIlepton*.conf\fR ini-like
configuration files.
It preforms essentially the same tasks as the \fBlepton-cli\fR(1)
Lepton EDA command-line tool, invoked with the \fIconfig\fR command.
However, it's not a front-end to that utility; \fBlepton-conf\fR
uses the \fBliblepton\fR configuration API directly.
